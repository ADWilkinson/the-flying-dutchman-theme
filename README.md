# The Flying Dutchman - Terminal & Editor Theme Collection

A nautical-inspired dark theme collection for terminals and code editors, inspired by the legendary ghost ship and Davy Jones himself.

## Theme Philosophy

The Flying Dutchman theme draws inspiration from:
- **Deep Ocean Blues**: The primary background colors echo the depths where the Dutchman sails
- **Aged Brass & Gold**: Syntax highlighting uses warm brass tones like those found on ship instruments
- **Sea Foam & Mist**: Variable and function colors mirror the ethereal sea spray
- **Weathered Wood & Iron**: UI elements feature muted tones of a ship worn by centuries at sea
- **Bioluminescent Accents**: Special highlights glow like creatures of the deep

- **Keywords**: Storm blue (#7fb3d5) - the color of approaching tempests
- **Strings**: Seaweed green (#48bb78) - life clinging to the hull
