# The Flying Dutchman - VSCode Theme

A dark VSCode theme inspired by the legendary ghost ship and Davy Jones himself. This theme captures the mysterious atmosphere of the deep ocean, with colors reminiscent of nautical charts, aged brass instruments, and the haunting beauty of a ship sailing through eternal fog.

## Theme Philosophy

The Flying Dutchman theme draws inspiration from:
- **Deep Ocean Blues**: The primary background colors echo the depths where the Dutchman sails
- **Aged Brass & Gold**: Syntax highlighting uses warm brass tones like those found on ship instruments
- **Sea Foam & Mist**: Variable and function colors mirror the ethereal sea spray
- **Weathered Wood & Iron**: UI elements feature muted tones of a ship worn by centuries at sea
- **Bioluminescent Accents**: Special highlights glow like creatures of the deep

## Color Palette

- **Background**: Deep ocean black (#0d1117) with darker abyss tones (#0b1929)
- **Foreground**: Misty sea spray (#a8c3d8) and aged parchment (#8b9dc3)
- **Keywords**: Storm blue (#7fb3d5) - the color of approaching tempests
- **Strings**: Seaweed green (#48bb78) - life clinging to the hull
- **Functions**: Caribbean blue (#5dade2) - tropical waters the ship once sailed
- **Constants**: Aged brass (#d4af37) - the gleam of old nautical instruments
- **Properties**: Turquoise (#4dc1b5) - shallow reef waters
- **Errors**: Blood red (#e53e3e) - danger on the high seas
- **Comments**: Fog grey (#4a5568) - whispers in the mist
